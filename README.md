## About CRUD

This is a simple Create, Read, Update, Delete application with the new version of laravel 6.x. Here is the basic steps which I followed to create a basic CRUD operation with customized theme setup, multiple types of login functionality and their dashboard.

- Make sure you have composer on your system. If not please use [composer](https://getcomposer.org/download/) link to get your required one.
- You should have PHP >= 7.2.0 to use laravel 6.x.
- Install a new laravel with composer  
Run `composer create-project --prefer-dist laravel/laravel crud-laravel-6x "6.*"`
- Run `php artisan serve` to start the server.
